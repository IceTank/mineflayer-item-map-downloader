### Supported minecraft versions
1.8.x - 1.19.3

## Installing
1. Install the plugin with npm
```bash
npm i --save mineflayer-item-map-downloader
```
2. Load the plugin with the mineflayer plugin API
```javascript
const { mapDownloader } = require('mineflayer-item-map-downloader')

bot.loadPlugin(mapDownloader) // load it before spawning to get all maps
```

## Examples
Look at the `examples` folder for out of the box examples.

## API

### `bot.mapDownloader.activate()`
Activates map downloading. The downloader is active by default. Note: This function is only available after `inject_allowed` has fired.

### `bot.mapDownloader.deactivate()`
Deactivate map downloading. Note: This function is only available after `inject_allowed` has fired.

## Options
This plugin extends the `BotOptions` type from mineflayer. Add them to the createBot options when creating the bot. You can also change them later by changing the `bot.mapDownloader` properties.

#### Example for an option
```javascript
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
  "mapDownloader-outputDir": "some/output/dir"
})
```

### "mapDownloader-outputDir"
  - Sets an output directory where maps should be saved. Maps are saved in the format `map_<map id>.png` where the map id has leading zeros.

### "mapDownloader-saveToFile"
  - If maps should be saved to file. If false maps are only stored internally. Usefull if you only want to look at maps with the web viewer. Default is `true`

### "mapDownloader-saveInternal"
  - If maps should be saved under maps. When downloading many maps this could prevent the process from using to much memory.

### "mapDownloader-filePrefix"
  - Saved maps file prefix

### "mapDownloader-fileSuffix"
  - Saved maps file suffix

## Events

### (`new_map_saved`, { name, id })
